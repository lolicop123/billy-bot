# billy-bot
A basic (and trash) Discord bot written in Python.

Relies on [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Nekos.py](https://github.com/Nekos-life/nekos.py) to function. 

# Installing:
This assumes you have Python3 + Pip set up, and that you are on a Windows machine.
1) Open Command Prompt as administrator
2) Type `py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py` and hit enter
3) Once installed, type `py -3 -m pip install -U nekos.py`
4) Go to the folder that you downloaded Billy Bot to, then right-click and edit "main.py"
5) Put your bots token into the field provided (at the top of the script.)
